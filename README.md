Bottom Panel GNOME Shell Extension
===

Overview
---

This is an extension for GNOME Shell 3.2 that adds a bottom panel to the shell.
The bottom panel includes a task bar and a button to show/hide the tray.

This code was heavily based on [the GNOME Shell Frippery project](http://intgat.tigress.co.uk/rmy/extensions/index.html) by Ron Yorston. Some parts were removed, like the workspace switcher, and I have added my own work, like switching windows by scrolling.

Future plans include:
---

+ Window options on right-click

+ Dragging and dropping windows

+ Tooltips

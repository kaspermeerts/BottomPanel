# Bottom Panel GNOME Shell Extension

This is an extension for GNOME Shell that adds a bottom panel to the shell.

The panel gives a simple overview of all open windows and makes it easy to switch between them, either by clicking on the desired window, or scrolling through them. Windows can be closed with a middle click of the mouse.

Future plans for this extension include dragging and dropping windows.
